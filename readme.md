Computational Geometry Project
==============================

Project is written in Processing: https://processing.org/download/

Controls:
* A - Add new vertex under mouse cursor
* D - Delete existing vertex under mouse cursor
* Mouse click - Drag existing vertex to another place
* R - Reload scene
* P - Toggle vertex visibility
* G - Generate 5 random vertices
* C - Generate convex hull using Gift wrapping algorithm
* V - Generate convex hull using Graham scan algorithm
* T - Create triangulation of polygon defined by all vertices in order of their addition, the last added vertex will be
automatically connected to the first, the polygon has to be y-monotone
* T after C/V - Create triangulation of generated convex hull
* K - Create k-D tree, vertices located directly on the splitting edges belong to the upper left part
* Y - Create Delaunay triangulation
* Y after C/V - Create Delaunay triangulation of generated convex hull
* U after Y - Generate Voronoi diagram from Delaunay triangulation
